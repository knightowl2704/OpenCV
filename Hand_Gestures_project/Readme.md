# Hand Gestures Recognition using OpenCV

- <h4> OpenCV
- <h4> Python

- The hand segmentation is based on skin color tracking and is thus highly influenced by lighting contitions.
- I plan to address this issue in upcoming updates. 
- As of now the code sucessfully draws the contours and convex hull across the hand and detects the fingers.
