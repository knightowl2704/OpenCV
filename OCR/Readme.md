1. This digit recognition is based on the stackoverflow post linked : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9413216/simple-digit-recognition-ocr-in-opencv-python/9620295#9620295
2. The model accurately predicts all the outcomes for the image pi.png
3. "pi.png" is the original test image from the StackOverFlow post.
4. However some errors can be seen with the "pi1.png file". "pi1.png" is created manually to test the model on different images.
